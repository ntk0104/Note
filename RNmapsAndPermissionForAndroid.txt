 I had the same issue as you. I managed to get the app running but now I get a message on the map screen that I need to update Google Play services. To fix the compilation error I have added:

   compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-base:+"
    compile "com.google.android.gms:play-services-maps:+"

to app.gradle. This seems a bit hacky and doesn't solve the map issue but at least you should be able to compile your app.

EDIT:

If you get an error about Dex exceeding max size of 65k add:

compile 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.0'

to your dependencies and:

multiDexEnabled true

under defaultConfig in your app.gradle

cd android
./gradle clean
